This repository provides examples of how to connect SQL databases with different programming languages.
It is designed as a reference for beginners and developers who want to quickly learn how to establish a connection, execute queries, and interact with SQL databases from their code.

Currently, the project includes a Python example using MySQL Connector, and in the future it will be extended with more languages such as Java (JDBC), Node.js, PHP, and others.
Each example will demonstrate essential database operations like connecting, creating tables, inserting data, and fetching results.
